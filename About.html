				Welcome to the Collegiate Computer Science's Webpage. This is our first year as a club. Currently our main projects are learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript for coding websites and on the computer hardware side we are building two computer servers.
				This is our first year as a club. We plan on creating our own servers and competing in CTF competitions, while also learning certain programming languages.
